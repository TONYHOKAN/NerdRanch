All example apps from Android Programming: The Big Nerd Ranch Guide book

The Big Nerd Ranch Guide Book for Android programming is the probably the best Android book out there.
In this collection of projects I add my own code implementations after following the book's chapters and solving almost all programming challenges. You can easily clone the project and import each sub project from Android Studio. It would be cool to share knowledge on how other developers tackle the code challenges.

The examples provided are based on the aforementioned book's Kindle July 2015 edition.
